- Pin net-imap to ~> 0.4.11 to keep appraisal bundles compatible with Ruby < 3.2.
- Use delegate for ApplicationMigration#connection to satisfy RuboCop.
- Replace delegate with explicit ApplicationMigration.connection to avoid argument errors.
- Disable Gemspec/RequiredRubyVersion for the gemspec required_ruby_version line.
- Add net-smtp dependency so mail can load under Ruby 3.3+.
- Ensure ApplicationMigration provides both instance and class connection methods.
